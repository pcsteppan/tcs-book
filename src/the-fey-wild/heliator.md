# Heliator

The Summer planet of Heliator is a place of unrelenting heat and blazing sunlight, where the very air seems to shimmer with waves of fiery energy. This hellish world is home to those who thrive in searing temperatures, including Night Mares, Salamander Folk, and the Summer Eladrin.

The landscape of Heliator is defined by rocky outcroppings and jagged cliffs which rise up from the scorched earth. The planet is dotted with volcanoes that spew molten lava and ash into the air, and rivers of fire.

There is relatively little known to outsiders about the true nature of Heliator and what it holds, besides rumors. If you were to ask the Summer Eladrin who live there what its like, chances are you'd hear less than half-truths.
