Sister planet of Golgari. There are myths that posit Golgari and Selesnya share a life force, that at one point Selesnya was old growth and Golgari was new growth. Jungle, Floodplains, Tall jagged mountains, Loooooooooong beaches. Animals and plants grow and evolve quickly. Interior dominated by territorial mega fauna. Most settlements are near coastlines. One of the largest is an Azorian settlement named Gutenberg.

Settlers of Gutenberg had a bloody history with the people of Golgari. A Dragon Turtle Tempest God named Shima combatted them and destroyed a World Tree in the process.

Centuries later, after a peace was reached, a migrating community to the south named Shima's Wake was suffering from a food desert being created by oinoliths hired by the Azorian governemnt as part of their logging operations. The Company Store helped Shima channel her remaining divinity into the creation of a new World Tree, alleviating the food desert within a certain radius. The community around this World Tree was renamed Shima's Rest.

The Party later helped Shima's Rest secure a shipping lane to the nearest Tributary, which had been monopolized by Azorian forces. They snuck aboard and sank Gutenberg's flagship the A.N.V. Protection, captained at the time by Gnarls, "The Mailman" Simitz, a grizzled Giff with a big musket. As thanks, Talofa, a Tortle druid community leader, organized an effort to build a ship for the party, a mushroom-inspired ship christend The Pileus.
