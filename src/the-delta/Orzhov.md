Hotbed of divine magic, ties to the Elemental Chaos and Shadowfell. Many deities have their highest office here. Twin moon with Rakdos, also mostly ocean, communities also based on islands and archipelagos mostly around the equator. ~500 years ago when the Styx first opened up, the planet Rakzhov was bombarded with Ice laden planetoids from the Astral Sea. The resulting debris formed two distinct bodies, sea levels rising extremely from the melting ice.

Mostly temperate, seasonal, with no extreme temperature change at either pole. The North pole is constantly shrouded in fog. The South pole is home to the Church of Charon. A very grand Styxport welcomes travelers with ships ready to take them to and from the various religious high offices. Seas are typically stormy and turbulent. The land is not the most fertile, relying somewhat on Rakdos to make up for crop deficits. However, many islands are home to dense forests, often used for ship building. (Maybe there is a dearth of trees on Rakdos, and we can have that food for wood trade be a primary interaction.) People from Orzhov and Rakdos are both considered exceptional in regards to ship design, sailing, and navigation. Lots of volatile weather all over the place - volcanic activity, strong winds, weeks long storms, as well as a forest that is always on fire. After Rakzhov split, the people of Orzhov embraced a more studious attitude toward understanding the universe, believing in objective truths that can be arrived at through rigorous dedication. "Gods deserve leaps of faith and aren't to be questioned lightly."
