# Rakdos

## Art Planet

**Theme:** Artistic Expression

**Vibes:** Pacific Islands, Theater kids, Auteurs, Nihilism, Wind Waker

Mostly tropical, but extreme cold at both poles (pools of supercooled water that freezes things on contact, maybe?). Once part of a larger planet with Orzhov. After an apocalyptic event the planet was split in two. Almost entirely ocean, communities are located on islands and archipelagos. Art styles are distinct between islands, like Galapagos finches. Every year there is an olympics type event where artists compete. Committed to art with a religious fervor, people go to literal war over creative differences. Highly influential culturally, a lot of popular books, plays, music, etc. come from Rakdos. People here are apt to be mediators and ambassadors for third parties, but there are also people that abuse that influence. Often a target of Shapeshifters and Mimics trying to infiltrate other organizations through the good will surrounding Rakdos. Chaotic, individualistic, "forge your own path, create your own meaning." Gods only deserve as much attention as they earn through direct action.
