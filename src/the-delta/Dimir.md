## Hidden Planet

**Theme:** Secrecy

**Vibes:** CIA, Thieves' Guild, John Wick, Bene Gesserit

Covered in a vantablack-like substance that makes it hard to find. There are rumors that the planet has somehow isolated itself from the Styx. Home of Shapeshifters and Mimics. A few high profile assasinations and coups in the past decades are rumored to be traced to Dimir operatives. Little else known.
