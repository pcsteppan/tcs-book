# Izzet

The surface of Izzet is as inhospitable as the surface of Simic. Incredibly tall, stark metal vents spew multicolored smoke, staining the surroundings like a frozen painted desert. Travel on the surface is only advisable during a few hours in the afternoon, and only with the right equipment and a destination in range. A tide of snow peaks hundreds of feet high in the dead of night - looking at the planet from the side it would appear oblong, like a many-jeweled Faberge egg.
