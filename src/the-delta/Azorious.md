Most populated and developed of all planets. Suffering from effects of overpopulation. Working relationship with Golgari refugees offering homes to those who will help with crop efforts. Mega-structures like Kowloon have farms on their rooves, and there are "steppes," a regulated greenspace outside Azorian Voting Halls that are heavily policed. Living conditions of refugees is terrible, and there have been reports of Green Bombings, where people covertly cast powerful Plant Growth spells on regulated greenspace to create Golgari like environments to live in.

A "True" Democracy, where almost everything about how neighborhoods are run is up for vote by anyone, but over the centuries the government has employed so much chicanery and obfuscation that it's very very difficult to actually organize efforts to change. Politicians and lawmages basically are those most able decipher this stuff, but corruption is rampant, and it's not uncommon for politicians to start manipulating voters to go against their best interests.
