## Boiling Ocean Planet

**Theme:** Bio-magical experimentation

**Vibes:** Rapture, bioluminescent, submersible dog fights, big Subnautica-type sea creatures

One *big* Tributary controlled by two factions. One faction is a religion headed by a Kraken god, the other is a kind of corporate-state run by a mysterious Water Elemental. There is a forever Storm/Whirlpool that moves across the planet's equator like the Eye of Jupiter. Almost all life is well below the waves, though there are things that are able to survive the surface. Some cities are anchored to coasts, others are mobile, with fleets of submersibles as the main means of conveyance.
