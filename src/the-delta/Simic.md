# Simic

## Boiling Ocean Planet

**Theme:** Bio-magical experimentation

**Vibes:** Rapture, bioluminescent, submersible dog fights, big Subnautica-type sea creatures

One *big* Tributary controlled by two factions. One faction is a religion headed by a Kraken god, the other is a kind of corporate-state run by a mysterious Water Elemental. There is a forever Storm/Whirlpool that moves across the planet's equator like the Eye of Jupiter. Almost all life is well below the waves, though there are things that are able to survive the surface. Some cities are anchored to coasts, others are mobile, with fleets of submersibles as the main means of conveyance.

**Fields of Foam**

As the sun bakes the sea, heated gas escapes the ocean and rises to the surface in a torrent of bubbles. These bubbles often carry up organic matter, where it collects and catalyzes into far reaching fields of biomatter.

Many communities on Simic rely on cultivating these fields, either for building material, sustenance, or as components for magical experimentation.

From a distance, Simic looks like idyllc fields, patches of browns and yellows stretching and swaying next to waves of greens and dark reds. On the surface, goopy geysers erupt with a strong and moldable pus, a nutritious slurry excretes out of a fleshlike field to be squeegee'd and collected by moisture farmers, scabbed over tide pools cultivate rare and complex life forms instrumental for certain biomagical processes.

**Foundries of Flesh**

Most structures and vehicles on Simic are covered in a film or skin that displaces heat, regulates pressure, and prevents corrosion. A city built into a coastline drifts in the currents like the tendrils of an anenome. Wandering, jellyfish-like mega structures house cities in their heads, manipulating their tendrils to move through the ocean and anchor to rocks during storms. Submersible communities of interconnected, individual crafts navigate between depths like clumps of sentient sargassum.
