# The Delta

Centuries ago The Delta was a system of 9 isolated planets on an isolated plane. Chance planar tears at certain times of the year would sporadically connect The Delta to The Feywild, or The Astral Sea, strange magic and creatures bleeding through like shards of sand blown across an ocean. Dragons were legends, goblins and eladrin, fairy tales. Life on other planets could only be guessed at across vast distances, islands in a dead sea.

Today, The Delta is the most interconnected it has ever been. Whole industries and religious domains are supported by niche interactions between planets and planes - be it through commerce, combat, communication, or just commuting from place to place. There are more Gods today than ever before.

## Connections

The Styx connects The Delta to The Astral Sea and the Fey Wild at two nexus points. They flow towards The Feywild during the Wet Season and the Astral Sea during the Dry. During the height of the Season these points of connection resemble, on one end, streams tumbling down from a mountaintop, and at the other, a roiling whirlpool.
